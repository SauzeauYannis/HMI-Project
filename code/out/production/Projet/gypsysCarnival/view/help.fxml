Your mother has given you 50 coins and you have 100 life points to reach your goal: enter the sparkling caravan.&#10;&#10;What are the places?&#10;When you start the game, you arrive in the central square of the carnival. There you will find 3 hubs ; copper, gold and platinum hub.&#10;Each of these hubs leads to 3 mini-game stands associated with the existing difficulty level (copper being the easiest, platinum the most difficult and gold in between).&#10;You will also find two stores, one selling food and the other selling keys. These two types of items are essential during your adventure.&#10;Finally, the last accessible place is the sparkling caravan which is locked during your entire adventure. The only way to unlock this place is to finish each of the 9 mini-games.&#10;To move to one of these locations, you just must click on it. You can also check the map for more details.&#10;&#10;How does the game play?&#10;At the beginning, each mini game is locked. To unlock one, you will need a key corresponding to the level of the mini-game and right click on it to use the key. &#10;Once unlocked, the game is forever accessible. The keys can be bought in the Key shop and are visible in the inventory if you have them. &#10;The price of a key is equal to its level. If you lose a game, you will lose life points. To get some back, you will have to eat a candy by clicking directly on the one of your choice in the inventory.  &#10;If you don't have any, go to the Candy shop to buy some. The price of the sweets will vary according to their calorie content. Be careful to not lose all your health points. &#10;If you do, the game ends and you must start from the beginning.If you win the game, you will be rewarded with coins. Obviously, you will earn more by winning higher rank games.&#10;&#10;To sum up the goal of the game is to finish all the available mini games while managing your life points.&#10;&#10;Good luck!"
